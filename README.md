# graphql-stateful-mock

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/graphql-stateful-mock.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/graphql-stateful-mock)

Mock a GraphQL schema â€” but in a stateful way.

Very similar to [GraphQL tools mocking](https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/mocking/) but produce a schema that is:
- **consistent**: the same query with the same arguments will, by default, return the exact same result
- **mutable**: one can implement mutations that will modify the results of subsequent queries

## Install

```sh
npm install graphql-stateful-mock -D
```
